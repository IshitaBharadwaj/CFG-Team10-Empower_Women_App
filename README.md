This app has been developed as a solution to address [Canasu Dream Foundation's](https://www.canasu.org/) problem statement. They aim to empower communities through their four programs for educating young girls and making them job ready.

### How to run the app
* cd into `/server` directory and run `npm install` to install all packages.
* Similarly cd into `/client` and run `npm install` to install all packages.
* In the server directory create a `config.env` file and provide values for the following fields `ATLAS_URI` (i.e., MongoDB atlas URI), `PORT` and `SECRET` (for jwtwebtokensecret)
* Run the server first then client next by `npm run start` command.
